# easyshop

This capstone project is an e-commerce application, or an online store, for a company
named EasyShop.

With a full website UI and Spring Boot API skeleton project provided, I was tasked with creating methods inside the API
to complete the website's functionality.

The website uses a Spring Boot API project for the backend server, with a
MySQL database for data storage and uses Postman to test functionality with the server.
